Hello, here is some text without a meaning. This text should show
what a printed text will look like at this place. If you read this
text, you will get no information. Really? Is there no information?
Is there a difference between this text and some nonsense like

gives you information about the selected font, how the letters are 
written and an impression of the look. This text should contain all 
letters of the alphabet and it should be written in of the original 
language. There is no need for special content, but the length of 
words should match the language.
