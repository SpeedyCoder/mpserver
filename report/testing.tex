\section{Performance Testing}
\label{sec:test}
In order to evaluate the performance of the \texttt{mpserver} toolkit we 
need to compare it against other server architectures.
This chapter presents the setup and results of the performance tests
that were carried on equivalent servers implemented in the \texttt{mpserver} toolkit,
in plain go, in \texttt{webpipes} toolkit by James Whitehead II~\cite{whitehead} 
and the Apache framework.

\subsection{Setup}
To compare the performance of the four server architectures, I 
implemented a simple file server in all of them. Their performance 
was tested on serving a 4KB static file. The code for the servers 
that were implemented in go is shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:testing.go}. To generate 
the load I used \texttt{httperf} tool~\cite{httperf}. This setup
is inspired by the one used in~\cite{whitehead}.
